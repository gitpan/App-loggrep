A command line utility to facilitate finding particular lines in a log file.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

If you have cpanminus, you can install it like so

    cpanm App-loggrep-0.001.tar.gz

If you don't have cpanminus, you can install that like so:

    cpan App::cpanminus

If you don't have cpan you likely don't have Perl, so you should attend to that first.

Thanks to Green River. I wrote this one morning to facilitate profiling SQL queries recorded in a Rails development log.
